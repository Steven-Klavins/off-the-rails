# Off the rails

### Off the rails is a short and sweet web app for posting articles

### I'm developing this app with a slightly modifide approach to the getting started with rails guide
### https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

The tech stack for this project is Ruby, Ruby On Rails RSpec and PostSQL.

## What you can do

As a user you can post update and delete articles, articles persist when running on a local database.
