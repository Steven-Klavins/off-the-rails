Off the rails a web app built in the Ruby on Rails frame-work, users can create, update, delete, and comment on articles. This project is an adaptation of the official [Getting Started with Rails Guide.](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) 


The tech stack for this project is Ruby, Ruby On Rails RSpec and PostSQL apposed to SQLight. In addition to this the app formats posts and has CSS styling.

**Future updates**

At present, there are a few things about this project I would like to add, probably the biggest being user authentication. If I deployed the site at this moment in time there would be no way of preventing users from editing articles under a false alias. However, to tell the truth, deployment was never really something I was planning on, the purpose of building this site was to help me learn Rails and in that, I did achieve my primary goal.
